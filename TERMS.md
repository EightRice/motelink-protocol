# TERMS for MoteLink Protocol

## Project Overview
MoteLink is a communication protocol for ultrasonic mote-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI). This project aims to develop a robust, low-latency protocol stack enabling reliable data transmission between implantable ultrasonic neural motes and external processing units.

## Terms and Conditions

### Good or Service Description
- **Description**: A communication protocol specification and reference implementation for ultrasonic neural mote networks.
- **Specifications**:
  - Protocol specification document (IEEE-style format)
  - Reference implementation in Rust
  - Simulation environment for protocol testing
  - Latency target: <10ms round-trip for command signals
  - Support for mesh topology with up to 1024 motes
- **Delivery Method**: All deliverables committed to this GitHub repository.

### Scope of Work
- Protocol design and formal specification
- Reference implementation with documented API
- Simulation framework for protocol validation
- Performance benchmarks and analysis
- Technical documentation and integration guide

### Project Duration and Milestones
- **Maximum Duration**: 4 months from contract signing.
- **Milestones**:
  - **M1 (Month 1)**: Protocol specification draft and architecture design
  - **M2 (Month 2)**: Reference implementation core modules
  - **M3 (Month 3)**: Simulation environment and initial benchmarks
  - **M4 (Month 4)**: Final documentation, optimization, and delivery
  - **Definition of Done**: All specifications complete, code compiles and passes tests, documentation reviewed, benchmarks meet latency targets.

### Payment Terms
- **Amount**: 1800 XTZ
- **Payment Schedule**: Released upon successful delivery and acceptance of the completed project.

### Delay and Extension Policy
- **Delay Penalties**: If the project is not completed within the specified duration, backers may vote to dispute.
- **Extension Requests**: Extensions may be negotiated with backer approval via on-chain voting.

### Confidentiality
- All project materials are publicly visible in this repository.
- No confidential information should be submitted.

### Dispute Resolution
- Disputes will be resolved by the designated arbiter as specified in the on-chain project contract.
- The arbiter will review this TERMS.md file and the contents of the `submissions` folder.
- Arbiter rulings may be appealed to the Jamaica Jurisdiction DAO.

### Appendices
- **Appendix A**: References to ultrasonic neural dust research (Berkeley, 2016), existing BCI protocols.
- **Appendix B**: Target hardware specifications and mote characteristics.
