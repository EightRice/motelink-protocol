# Trustless Business Repository Guide

## Introduction
This repository is part of the Trustless Business Ecosystem, designed to facilitate secure and transparent on-chain business arrangements. It serves as a structured workspace for managing and documenting project deliverables.

## Repository Structure
- **README.md**: Project-specific description and overview.
- **TERMS.md**: The detailed terms and conditions of the business agreement, including project scope, deliverables, payment terms, and dispute resolution mechanisms.
- **submissions/**: A dedicated folder for project submissions, including work products, supporting documents, and any materials relevant to the project or potential disputes.

## Using This Repository

### For Project Creators
- Customize the `README.md` to describe your specific project.
- Customize the `TERMS.md` file to reflect the specific terms and conditions of your project.
- Use the `submissions` folder to upload project deliverables and relevant documents.

### For Contractors
- Review the `README.md` for project context and goals.
- Review the `TERMS.md` file thoroughly to understand the project requirements and terms.
- Submit your work and any related documents to the `submissions` folder as per the project's terms.

## Project Lifecycle
- **Initiation**: A project is initiated by customizing the `README.md` and `TERMS.md` files to suit the specific business arrangement.
- **Execution**: Parties involved in the project collaborate and communicate as per the terms defined in `TERMS.md`.
- **Completion**: Upon project completion, deliverables are submitted to the `submissions` folder, and the project is reviewed against the terms of `TERMS.md`.

## Dispute Resolution
In case of disputes, the `TERMS.md` file and contents of the `submissions` folder serve as the primary reference points. The designated arbiter will use these documents to resolve any disagreements according to the specified resolution process.
